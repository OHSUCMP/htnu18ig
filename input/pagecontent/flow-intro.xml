    <p>
        The following flowcharts represent the decision logic we developed from a review of 71 Hypertension recommendations
        taken from 8 different guidelines (per Alper et al.). Of these 71 recommendations, 42 have agreement between multiple
        guidelines. Any recommendation that was disagreed upon by direction (recommended to use in treatment versus recommended
        NOT to use in treatment) was excluded from this logic. All recommendations that were disagreed upon by strength of
        recommendation (weak "for" vs strong "for") are included in this logic, but output indicates users should "consider"
        as a care option rather than "recommend" as a course of action.
    </p>
    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <p>The decision logic for all workflows contains some common concepts defined in this section.</p>

    <h4>Blood Pressure readings</h4>
    <p>Workflow logic referring to "all" BP readings refers to all readings taken in the previous 2 years.
      Blood Pressure observations must be in the ValueSet
      <a href="http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.3.600.2012">http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.3.600.2012</a>
      and must have a unit mm[Hg] and a status of 'final', 'amended', or 'corrected'.
    </p>
    <p>
      A BP observation is considered to be a home reading if BPObservation.extension value contains a measurementSetting with SNOMED Code ‘264362003’.
      Otherwise, it is considered an office reading. In practice, there were challenges getting ambulatory monitoring procedures for blood pressure
      from a real FHIR implementation so ambulatory observations are not currently considered.
    </p>

    <h4>Very High Blood Pressure reading</h4>
    <p>
      If the system detects a home or office based blood pressure is >= 180 mmHg systolic OR >=110 mmHg diastolic within the previous 2 weeks, an alert will be displayed
      at the top of the recommendations when they are next loaded. The recommendation is congruent with guidelines: a high blood pressure MAY
      be concerning, but doesn’t automatically tell the user if they have a hypertensive emergency or urgency, both of which require symptoms
      to diagnose. In all cases, they are recommended to contact their care team or seek care immediately if they have symptoms; otherwise,
      they are asked to remeasure their blood pressure and contact if their care team is still high. A link is provided to additional resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      This component may be edited by those who want to enact additional safety protocols – the language can be changed by changing the recommendation text for the card, available in the CQL. Please review this section with your local clinical standards committees to be assured it meets expectations for such a tool.
    </p>

    <h4>Last Set of Blood Pressure readings</h4>
    <p>
      In order to generate useful recommendations, the decision support system needs to have a minimum number of blood pressure
      readings taken over the last 2 years to be used as the most recent "set" of BPs in several calculations. The initial approach
      was to require at least 12 hours of ambulatory readings, 4 office readings, or 6 home readings to establish the set and to prioritize
      which set was used based on the presumed accuracy of the source (Ambulatory > Office > Home). But different types
      of readings may be interspersed throughout the 2 year period, potentially leading to more recent readings being discarded from
      analysis if they weren't part of the prioritized set.
    </p>

    <p>
      To avoid these pitfalls, a point system is employed to define the most recent BP set. Each blood pressure reading is assigned points as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Office observation = 1 point</li>
      <li>Home observation = .667 points</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A patient must have at least <strong>4 points</strong> total in observations from the last 2 years to have a set. And the most recent BP set would be the minimum number of
      most recent readings that add up to 4. In the example below, the most recent 4 home and 2 office readings would be used:
    </p>

    <h4>Blood Pressure Variability</h4>
    <p>
      If a set of blood pressure observations is found, systolic readings for the last 2 years are also checked for high variability. Blood pressure variability is independently predictive of poor outcomes; however, due to the significant measurement inaccuracies from both home and office blood measurement
      in practice, much blood pressure variability is due to this measurement error. In addition, the effects of blood pressure variability are most significant over the long term,
      with mixed evidence over the short and medium term. Thus, we set the threshold for the identification of variability at a very high level - > a standard deviation of > 11 mmHg.
      This level is the most associated with poor outcomes. Removing this criterion or changing the language may be useful for some groups to model their local clinical needs.
      See <em>Stevens SL, Wood S, Koshiaris C, Law K, Glasziou P, Stevens RJ, McManus RJ. Blood pressure variability and cardiovascular disease: systematic review and meta-analysis. BMJ. 2016 Aug 9;354:i4098. doi: 10.1136/bmj.i4098. PMID: 27511067; PMCID: PMC4979357</em> for details.
    </p>

    <p>If high variability is identified, a recommendation for ambulatory monitoring is provided.</p>
    <h4>Qualifying Blood Pressure Goal</h4>
    <p>
      Many of the recommendations are generated by comparing the patient's current blood pressure to their stated blood pressure goal.
      Implementers may want to create a default Goal for the patient if one does not already exist so that these recommendations fire.
      The goal must have a lifecyleStatus in ('proposed', 'planned', 'accepted', 'active', 'completed').
      The goal should have a single target, with one measure in the ValueSet for Systolic Blood Pressure
      (<a href="http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1104.2">http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1104.2</a>) and one measure
      in the Value Set for Diastolic Blood Pressure (<a ref="http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.3.526.2.1045">http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.3.526.2.1045</a>).
      Both measures must have detail that is a quantity with unit mm[Hg].
    </p>
    <h4>Patient "On Track" to Reach Blood Pressure Goal</h4>
    <p>Usually, a patient with high blood pressure will receive recommendations for lifestyle changes first and will only be referred to medicinal therapies
      if they are not "on track" to reach their blood pressure goal. The patient is considered on track if any of the following are true:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>They have no active BP goal, so their progress cannot be determined.</li>
      <li>They don't have a BP set, so whether the goal has been met cannot be determined.</li>
      <li>The goal has been met.</li>
      <li>They have been working toward their goal for less than 3 months.</li>
    </ul>
