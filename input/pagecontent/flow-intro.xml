  <h3>Workflow Functional Descriptions</h3>

  <p>These are the workflows that we adapted for the logic to work appropriately and safely. Details about each endpoint (numbered) can be seen by examining the CDS Cards component and the logic that appears within them. Each workflow is handled separately, but are ordered such that safety concerns are at the top of the recommendation list.</p>
