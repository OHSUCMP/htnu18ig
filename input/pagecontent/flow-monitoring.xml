  <p>
    If a patient who has a diagnosis of hypertension accesses this tool, this workflow will run.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, the tool checks to see if the patient has a current blood pressure goal. If the patient does not, it sets a default goal of &lt;140/90 mmHg and checks to see if the patient would like to adjust that goal. The tool will then check whether it can
    find a complete set of blood pressure readings. If it cannot, it will recommend taking additional blood pressure readings either at home or in a clinical setting.
  </p>
  <p>
    If either all blood pressure readings or the set of blood pressures averages greater than 140/90 mmHg, the tool will recommend that the patient begin both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment to control their blood pressure. These are
    separate workflows.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the set of blood pressure readings are above the patient’s goal, the tool will recommend that the patient begin non-pharmacologic treatment. If blood pressure remains above goal after three months of non-pharmacologic treatment, the tool will then
    recommend beginning pharmacologic treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the patient’s blood pressure is below their goal but is <a href="flow-intro.html#blood-pressure-variability">highly variable</a>, more data may be required to obtain an accurate picture of the patient’s blood pressure, and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring will be recommended. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If blood pressure is below goal and not especially variable, the tool will recommend ongoing monitoring but no further recommendations will be provided unless changes in blood pressure are detected.
