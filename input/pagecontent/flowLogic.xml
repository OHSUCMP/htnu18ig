    <h3>Decision Logic</h3>
    <p>
        The following flowcharts represent the decision logic we developed from a review of 71 Hypertension recommendations
        taken from 8 different guidelines (per Alper et al.). Of these 71 recommendations, 42 have agreement between multiple
        guidelines. Any recommendation that was disagreed upon by direction (recommended to use in treatment versus recommended
        NOT to use in treatment) was excluded from this logic. All recommendations that were disagreed upon by strength of
        recommendation (weak "for" vs strong "for") are included in this logic, but output indicates users should "consider"
        as a care option rather than "recommend" as a course of action.
