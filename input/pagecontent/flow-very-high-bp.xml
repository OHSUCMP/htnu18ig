    <p>
      If the system detects a home or office based blood pressure is >= 180 mmHg systolic OR >=120 mmHg diastolic within the previous 2 weeks, a recommendation is generated. In the reference application, an alert will be displayed
      at the top of the recommendations to call attention to this condition. The recommendation is congruent with guidelines: a high blood pressure MAY
      be concerning, but doesn’t automatically tell the user if they have a hypertensive emergency or urgency, both of which require symptoms
      to diagnose. In all cases, they are recommended to contact their care team or seek care immediately if they have symptoms; otherwise,
      they are asked to remeasure their blood pressure and contact if their care team is still high.

      This component may be edited by those who want to enact additional safety protocols – the language can be changed by changing the recommendation text for the card, available in the CQL.
      Please review this section with your local clinical standards committees to be assured it meets expectations for such a tool.
