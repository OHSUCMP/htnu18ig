    This describes the overall approach to implementing the Clinical Decision
    Support system. Subsequent sections explore the various customizations to the
    more standardized approach. The CDS Hooks framework is used to tap into the patient
    view action, execute plan definitions for each of the workflows, and return
    relevant recommendations.

  <h3>Customization of CDS Cards Components</h3>

  <p>
    Recommendations are returned as <a href="https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/1.0/#card-attributes">CDS Cards</a>.
    However, during implementation, we found the rigid structure of cards was placing
    limitations on the richness of the output we
    wanted to support. For example, we wanted the ability to return both a patient-facing
    and a provider-facing recommendation in the same card to avoid duplication of code and
    allow the client more flexibility in what to display. We also wanted to provide custom
    suggestions that could easily be displayed as components in a web application, allowing the
    patient to interact with them to contact their care team or set a goal, for example.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 'detail' field of CDS Cards is used to encapsulate all of the customization. This field
    is a pipe-delimited string with 4 elements:
    <ul>
      <li>Rationale</li>
      <li>Suggestions</li>
      <li>Selection Behavior</li>
      <li>Links</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h4>Rationale</h4>

  <p>
    The rationale is the descriptive text for the recommendation. It provides the patient
    or provider more detailed information about why the recommendation was made or how it can
    be accomplished. To allow the rationale to be tailored to the audience (patient vs. provider),
    we employ Mustache-style templates to separate the two recommendations. Anything inside the
    patient template can be displayed to the patient, and anything inside the careTeam template
    can be displayed to the provider. For example:
  </p>

  <pre>{% raw %}{{patient}}Consider limiting your salt intake.{{/patient}}{{careTeam}}Discuss limiting salt intake with patient.{{/careTeam}}{% endraw %}</pre>

  <p>
    The rationale may also contain string escaped HTML formatting elements to provide emphasis or other visual
    cues.
  </p>

  <pre>You recently had a condition recorded that &lt;strong&gt;may be an adverse event&lt;/strong&gt; from high blood pressure treatment.</pre>

  <h4>Suggestions</h4>

  <p>
    Because we wanted to provide a more interactive feel to the decision support model, most of
    the customization is in the suggestions element of the card's detail field. This complex
    logic supports a number of different suggestion types. An attribute "type" is added to the
    suggestion element, and 6 kinds of suggestions are supported.

    <ul>
      <li>Follow a Link (suggestion-link)</li>
      <li>Get Counseling (counseling-link)</li>
      <li>Set a Blood Pressure Goal (bp-goal)</li>
      <li>Set a Behavioral Goal (goal)</li>
      <li>Update Behavioral Goal Progress (update-goal)</li>
      <li>Confirm Adverse Event Treatment (adverse-event)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Multiple suggestions are possible for any single recommendation and do not
    have to be of the same type. For example, if a patient is a current smoker,
    they may get two suggestions - one to get counseling and one to set a goal.
    A suggestion must always have an id. This id is somewhat arbitrary except
    when suggesting a behavioral goal, as will be discussed later.
  </p>

  <h5>Follow a Link</h5>

  <p>
    This is meant for general actions we want the patient to take such as entering
    more blood pressure readings. The suggestion will often contain a hard-coded
    relative url that would need to be implemented. Multiple links are possible
    for a single suggestion using the actions array.
  </p>

  <pre>[{
    "id": "suggestion-id",
    "type": "suggestion-link",
    "label": "Actions:",
    "actions": [
        {"label":"Contact your care provider", "url":"/contact"},
        {"label":"Enter more Blood Pressure readings", "url":"/bp-readings"}
    ]
}]</pre>

  <p>
    The CQL suggestion that links to an implementing application's contact page has special processing that provides a token in the url. For example:
  </p>

  <pre>[{
    "id": "suggestion-id",
    "type": "suggestion-link",
    "label": "Actions:",
    "actions": [
        {"label":"Contact us", "url":"/contact?token=possible-htn-stage2‚Äù}
    ]
}]</pre>

  <p>
    The implementing application can associate these tokens with a message that could be used to prepopulate the contact form. For example:
  </p>

  <img height="200px" src="contact-form.png" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:15px 0px" alt="Contact Form Example"/>

  <h5>Get Counseling</h5>

  <p>
    This is similar to following a link with a few differences:

    <ul>
      <li>A FHIR Procedure record should be created indicating the patient was counseled.</li>
      <li>A references object is provided to be saved with the counseling record. This allows the decision support system to distinguish between different types of counseling (e.g. smoking vs weight loss)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Here is an example counseling suggestion</p>
  <pre>[{
    "id": "smoking-counseling",
    "type": "counseling-link",
    "references": {"system":"http://snomed.info/sct", "code":"225323000"},
    "label": "Suggested Counseling:",
    "actions": [
        {"label":"Learn more about tobacco cessation.", "url":"/counseling/smoking-cessation"}
    ]
}]</pre>

  <p>The implementing application would create a link with an onclick event and an internal page "/counseling/smoking-cessation" that provides counseling resources related to smoking. When the link is clicked, the implementing application must create either locally or in the FHIR server a procedure resource for the counseling session using the system and code provided in the suggestion. On subsequent executions of decision support, this counseling resource would be used to trigger different recommendations.</p>

  <h5>Set a Blood Pressure Goal</h5>

  <p>This suggestion allows the implementing application to create a component for a patient to set a blood pressure goal. The application can then construct a Goal like <a href="Goal-BloodPressureGoal.html">this example</a> and provide to the decision support system to update recommendations.</p>
  <pre>[{
    "id": "bp-radio-goal",
    "label": "BP Goal",
    "type": "bp-goal",
    "references":{"system":"https//coach.ohsu.edu", "code":"blood-pressure"},
    "actions": [
        {"label":"140/90"},
        {"label":"130/80"},
        {"label":"120/80"}
    ]
}]</pre>


  <h4>Selection Behavior</h4>

  <p>There is no customization of selection-behavior. For now, all recommendations use 'at-most-one'.</p>

  <h4>Links</h4>

  <p>
    There is no real customization for links except that we do not provide the required element 'type'.
    This is really just a convenience, as the type is always 'absolute'.
